# The Pythion Oracle
Final project for IEOR 4572 (Data Analytics in Python for OR), Spring 2017

## Webpage
The working web application runs on localhost.

## Project Details
This program correlates social statistics (such as teen pregnancy rate, percentage of the population with access to clean drinking water, etc.) with expected lifespan in countries around the world. The application computes a linear regression, correlation coefficient, and other statistical metrils for a selected attribute and plots the values with a line of best fit. It also generates an interactive color/heat map that displays the attribute value for a given country when it is hovered over. 

The goal of this project was to encourage a more comprehensive understanding of how expected lifespan is dependent upon various social factors within countries across the globe. It was also designed to highlight which factors most strongly or weakly correlate with lifespan. Furthermore, this cool can be used to aid humanitarian efforts in distributing resources more effectively and optimizing regional impact.

## Data Sources
The life span data was taken from the World Health Organization [website](http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/Annex_B/en/).

## Technology
This program was written in Python3 and uses Flask, a web application framework for Python that helps build interactive web applications.
