Final Project: Data Analytics in Python for Operations Research (IEOR 4572)

This program uses information made freely-available by the World Head Organization at:

http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/Annex_B/en/ 

to create a web application that correlates various attributes with the expected lifespan in various countries. 
The application computes a linear regression and other statistic metrics for a selected attribute and plots the 
values with a line of best fit, while also generating an interactive map that displays the attribute value for 
each country. The goal of the project was to encourage a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors 
that are interdependent or dependent upon expected lifespan in various regiouns across the globe, as well as which 
factors most strongly or weakly correlate with expected lifespan. This could then be used to aid humanitarian 
efforts in distributing resources more effectively.
