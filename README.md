# The Pythion Oracle
Final project for IEOR 4572 (Data Analytics in Python for OR), Spring 2017

## Webpage
The working web application runs on localhost.

## Project Details


## Data Sources
The life span data was taken from the World Health Organization [website](http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/Annex_B/en/).

## Technology
This program was written in Python3 and uses Flask, a web application framework for Python that helps build interactive web applications.


to create a web application that correlates various attributes with the expected lifespan in various countries. 
The application computes a linear regression and other statistic metrics for a selected attribute and plots the 
values with a line of best fit, while also generating an interactive map that displays the attribute value for 
each country. The goal of the project was to encourage a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors 
that are interdependent or dependent upon expected lifespan in various regiouns across the globe, as well as which 
factors most strongly or weakly correlate with expected lifespan. This could then be used to aid humanitarian 
efforts in distributing resources more effectively.




Our groupâ€™s project uses information made freely-available by the World Health Organization at http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2016/Annex_B/en/ to create a web application that correlates various attributes with the expected lifespan in various countries. The application computes a linear regression for a selected attribute and plots the values with a line of best fit, while also generating an interactive map that displays the attribute value for each country. The goal of our project was to encourage a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors that are interdependent or dependent upon expected lifespan in various regions across the globe, as well as which factors most strongly or weakly correlate with expected lifespan.
Our application could be optimized for more efficient runtimes and greater user-friendliness, while relatively minor components of the application could be augmented to support smarter analysis of the dataset by isolation countries by geographic region, economic development, shared socio-cultural institutions, etc. The dataset could also be supplemented with alternative datasets orthogonal to that provided by the World Health Organization, such as GDP per capita or GDP growth rates, and this would expand the domain of attributes available for analysis and computation, further enhancing our understanding of the various factors influencing the lifespan of human beings across the globe. These improvements can be easily implemented,
however, allowing The Pythion oracle to rapidly compute the relationships affecting our lifespans.
